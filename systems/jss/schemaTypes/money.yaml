title: Money
documentation: An amount of money designated in a specific currency.
examples:
- value:
    amount: 9999
    scaler: 2
    currency: gbp
  documentation: In this example the scaler of 2 means that we shift the decimal point
    2 places to the left.  So 9999 becomes 99.99 for display.

  properties:
    amount:
      $ref: integer
      documentation: |-
        This property stores an integral amount of money in a currencies minor denomination.  For
        example, in America they use dollars and cents, so figures should be stored in cents.
    scaler:
      $ref: integer
      documentation: |-
        This property indicates how many places we
        need to move the decimal place to convert from the minor to the major currency.  The
        use of a scaler ensures that monetary amounts are stored as integers rather than
        floats.  This makes it easier to work with monetary amounts; for example, equality
        checks on integers are reliable whereas equality checks on floating point numbers
        are subject to many intracies depending on the platform used.
    currency:
      $ref: currencyCode
      documentation: A value from the currencyCode enumeration that indicates the currency in use.
