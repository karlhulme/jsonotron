kind: string
system: jss
name: ipv6
summary: A string of digits that identify a computer on a network in IP v6 format.
  It will match values such as ::1 and 2a00:23c5:1ab0:3001:1776:5ae:499f:114a.
  The regex is an approximation and further validation may be desired.
  A standard ipv6 address is at most 45 chars but an ipv6 address can also include
  an ending % followed by a "scope" or "zone" string such as "eth0", "eth1", "wlan0".  For this
  reason the maximum length is extended to 55.
maximumLength: 55
regex: ^([0-9A-Fa-f]{0,4}:){2,7}([0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4}$|((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)(\.|$)){4})$
