kind: enumScalar
system: jss
name: yesNo
summary: |-
  A binary choice between yes or no. This type can be used where a third option may be introduced in the future.
  In that scenario a boolean field would be limiting, but a yesNo field could be replaced by a new enum without having to migrate existing data.
items:
- value: 'yes'
  text: 'Yes'
- value: 'no'
  text: 'No'
