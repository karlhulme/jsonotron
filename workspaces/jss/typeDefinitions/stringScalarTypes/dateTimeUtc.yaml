kind: stringScalar
system: jss
name: dateTimeUtc
summary: A string with the date and time components arranged using the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ
  pattern. Leading zeroes must be used to ensure that all values are the same length.
  The string must always end with a Z to indicate that value is based on UTC and not
  an alternative time zone.
  The regex checks that numbers appear in the correct location but will not pickup invalid
  date/times like 2020-02-31T12:00:00Z.
