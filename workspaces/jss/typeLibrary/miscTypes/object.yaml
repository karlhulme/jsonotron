kind: object
system: jss
name: plainObject
summary: Any valid JSON object.  The underlying data store may impose a limit on the
  depth of the JSON object.  You cannot store a null value.  Care should be taken
  not to supply an object of such depth or serialized size that the underlying data
  store cannot save it.  Wherever possible, define a set of types with a specific shape
  rather than using this type.
