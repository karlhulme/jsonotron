summary: A string with the date components arranged using the YYYY-MM-DD pattern.  If
  the day or month component is a value less than 10 then a leading zero must be included.  This
  ensures that all stored dates are the same length.
  The regex checks that numbers appear in the correct location but will not pickup invalid
  dates like 2020-02-31.
