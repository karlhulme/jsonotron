title: Money
documentation: An amount of money designated in a specific currency.
  
  The `amount` property stores an integral amount of money in a currencies minor denomination.
  Each currency defines a scalar which indicates how many places the decimal point is shifted
  to the left, in order to convert to a currencies major denomination.  Storing the data in the 
  minor denomination ensures that most currency manipulation and equality checks can be performed
  using integers rather than floating point numbers.
  
  The `currency` indicates which currency this monetary amount represents.
examples:
- value:
    amount: 9999
    currency: GBP
  documentation: In this example, the GBP currency defines a scaler of 2, which means that we shift the decimal point
    2 places to the left.  So 9999 becomes Â£ 99.99 for display.
