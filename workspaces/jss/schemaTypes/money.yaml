      j-documentation: This value stores an integral amount of money in a currencies minor denomination.
        Each currency defines a scalar which indicates how many places the decimal point is shifted
        to the left, in order to convert to a currencies major denomination.  Storing the data in the 
        minor denomination ensures that most currency manipulation and equality checks can be performed
        using integers rather than floating point numbers.
