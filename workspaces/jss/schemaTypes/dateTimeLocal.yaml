  An object that captures a date and time in a specific time zone.

  The `dateTime` property records the date and time in the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+Z format.  Notice
  that the pattern always has a T between the date and time components and that the
  time zone is always expressed with 2 digits for hours and 2 digits for minutes.
  
  The `timeZone` property records where in the world the time applies.  It is a timeZone
  value.
  
  The `timestamp` property records when the date and time was captured.  It
  is a timestamp value.  This is useful for advanced scenarios where the behaviour
  of a time zone is changed at some point in the future.  Knowing when the capture
  was made allows you to pinpoint the rules at the point and then convert to the prevailing
  rules.  Leading zeroes must be used to ensure that all values are the same length.
examples:
- value:
    dateTime: '2010-06-08T05:30:12+01:00'
    timeZone: europe/london
    captured: 1563119540628
  documentation: The europe/london time zone operates at +00:00 during the winter
    and +01:00 during the summer.  In this example we can see the value is in the
    summer because of the +01:00 suffix.
